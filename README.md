# making-strong-AI-automatically
A place to talk about "how to automatically create strong artificial intelligence".

A neural network that edits (deletes, creates) neural networks.

Its input is the state of the node (neuron) or the existence of a specific neural network.

Output is the state of a node (neuron) or "deleting, creating a specific neural network".

Optimize these neural networks with evolutionary algorithms.
